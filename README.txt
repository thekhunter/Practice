This is a Sudoku Checker that I coded as my first project while learning javascript.
It takes columns, rows, and sections from a 2d array of 9 arrays each including
9 numbers, and checks that they contain the numbers 1 through 9 with no repeats, returning true or
false regarding if the puzzle input is valid.
